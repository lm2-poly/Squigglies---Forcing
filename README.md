First repository, so please don't get mad at me. I'm really sensitive.

- "Complete_FFT.m" contains the MATLAB code used to,first, numerically solve the standard Geometrical Model; that is, the one established in "Standard_GM.m" when forcing is null (LR = 0). It also provides its FFT scheme and determines the SR-pattern frequency (defined as the first primary Y-axis frequency). Lastly, while using this said frequency to compare with a perturbation frequency, it solves the forced ODE -as done in "Forced_GM.m". Again, a FFT graph is shown.
