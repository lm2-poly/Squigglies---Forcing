First repository, so please don't get mad at me. I'm really sensitive.

- "Sinusoidal.m" contains the MATLAB code used to numerically solve the Geometrical Model of the movement produces by a viscous thread falling onto a moving belt, while being transversally perturbated in a sinusoidal-like motion.

  The movement is dependent on three dimensionless parameters: quotients of speed, time and length.
  
  The code includes the declaration of the ODE function, as well as the plotting of the results.
